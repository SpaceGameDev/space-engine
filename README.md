# SpaceEngine
My project to create a game. This repo contains the engine of my game. It is designed to be highly modular, so customization and only partial usage is entirely possible. 
The root gradle project contains all utility classes which do not depend on any other library or require special initialization. Subprojects may require additional libraries or initialization.
