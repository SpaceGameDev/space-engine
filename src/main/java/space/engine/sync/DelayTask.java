/**
 * This Exception can be thrown during the execution of any Task (based upon {@link AbstractTask}) to 'delay' the execution finish.
 * The Task catching the {@link DelayTask} should not finish it's execution until the {@link #barrier} with that the {@link DelayTask} was constructed is triggered.
 * If the Task is a {@link Future} of any kind (including {@link FutureWithException} and variations),
 * the barrier should be a Future which result is to use as it's own result (including any declared Exceptions). As it is not possible to do compile-time checks,
 * implementations should have a result of null if the barrier is not a Future or rethrow any Exception uncaught which it cannot handle.
 * It is recommended that implementations use {@link BaseFuture} as these Methods are implemented by all types of {@link Future}.
