 * AbstractTask implements {@link Barrier} waiting and {@link SyncLock} locking.

 * If you DON'T require any initialization before execution use the {@link #AbstractTask(SyncLock[], Barrier[])} Constructor
 * but also delegate to the {@link #AbstractTask(SyncLock[])} while keeping it protected.
 * However if some initialization is required before the Task is executed, call the {@link #AbstractTask(SyncLock[])} Constructor, initialize what is needed
 * and call {@link #init(Barrier[])} afterwards. Failing to call {@link #init(Barrier[])} will cause this Task to never execute.
